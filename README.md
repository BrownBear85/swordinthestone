## About
Sword in the Stone is a weapon mod that aims to improve exploration by adding fun and unique swords that the player can find throughout the world. **The mod is available for Forge 1.18.2, 1.19.2, 1.19.3, 1.19.4, & 1.20.1. No dependencies are required.**
## Sword Stones
Sword stones are structures that can be found in all 3 vanilla dimensions. They each contain a unique sword which have different variants depending on the biome that they are found in. Unique swords have random attack damage and attack speed stats **as well as each having a random magic ability that is displayed as an overlay on the item textures**. Hold right click on the stone to retrieve the sword.

Until a player retrieves the sword from a stone, the sword shoots a laser straight up periodically to allow the player to find it more easily.

## Abilities
Each sword has one of 8 different magic abilities. This is described in the sword's tooltip and affects the color of the sword's name. Some abilities are passive, while others are activated by right-clicking.
